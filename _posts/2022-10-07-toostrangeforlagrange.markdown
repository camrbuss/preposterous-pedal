Today was a perfect ride that was spaced out with breaks throughout the day. Overcast skies allowed everyone to ride their own pace without attempting to beat the sun.

The start of the ride weaved through downtown Austin giving me the thrill of city riding, but the roads quickly settled down as it turned back into Texas countryside. This herd of cattle seemed a little close together, but my expression shows my naivety.

There was an iconic truck stop for cars that had a Texas sized everything. Three awnings full of gas pumps, four soda fountains, at least fifty urinals, and lots of deer corn for ‚Äúhunting‚Äù.

We had lots of scary dogs on the ride today, but I just remained calm and rode away.  Everyone else seemed to require at least 30 minutes of complaining about the dogs ü§∑ These vultures looked scarier to me.

The ride ended with this wacky sign. Can someone explain this when the terrain was flat?

Finally the day ended with some good ol Texas high school football. It was so funny seeing high schoolers be high schoolers. High school offers so much opportunity yet I feel like most kids are too caught up in the social complexities of maturing to enjoy the privilege. But hey, it was a lot of fun to people watch.
