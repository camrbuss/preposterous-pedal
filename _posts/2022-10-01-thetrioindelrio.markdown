Today wasn’t classified as a rest day because we rode 35 miles into Del Rio, but for all intensive purposes we all rested the entire day.

The ride was a little windy but great as always!

Before I got to the church, I went to Walyworld and stocked up on Oreos, fig newtons, Pop Tarts, Cliff Bars, and Cereal. I feel so safe and secure having an abundance of food after desolate West Texas.

At the church I got to eat lots of food, read, and work on my cross stitch.  Donna-Claire Chesman writes in *The Book of Mac* “If we spend our time waiting for the big things to unfold, we’ll have waited all our lives in anticipation and done absolutely zero living.” and then Mac raps “You’re never too old for joy. You can be a kid forever.”

I took this into my own hands and flipped on the PA system and got the three youngsters to do karaoke. 🎤 

Lots of hanging out and good conversation. Doing nothing wouldn’t feel nearly as good if we weren’t constantly riding though.🛋🍩
