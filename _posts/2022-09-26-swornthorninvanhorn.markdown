Today was a late start due to it being only a 34 mile day. This meant most of the team went to the only cafe in town and got a Mexican style breakfast. Delicious!

Immediately after starting riding the intense head wind dictated some teamwork. Seth and I traded off pulling each other for the first 22 miles while averaging about 14.5mph. It was hard, boring, and miserable. This was my view.

It seriously felt like the hardest day so far, so at the rest stop I decided I would ride alone and at my own pace. Oh my goodness, it was so much better. Seth and I were pretty much always a couple hundred feet from each other, but the space allowed me to embrace West Texas.

I am so excited to redefine my perception of Texas geography and society. Van Horn is a pretty cool town featuring a Blue Origin launch facility. Tomorrow is Marfa, which is apparently like 10x Austin, but like 1/100 the size. 🎨🎶☕️🦛

The team seems to be reunited and focused on our mission. Super excited to pedal through 75 miles of Texas tomorrow!

I thought I wanted to get into motorcycles, but the high of physical exertion is pretty darn addicting.
