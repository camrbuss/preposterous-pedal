The start of Texas Hill Country has begun and will continue to grow over the next days. Although it‚Äôs dryer and hotter than the foot hills of Appalachia, there is a great sense of comfort and life creeping out of the landscape.

Even though I‚Äôve been in nothingness a lot of this trip, the roads have always had relatively constant traffic. Some of todays roads felt more like home, but instead of a house every quarter mile, there were ranches every two miles. The roads silent beauty called for a celebration of freedom. I felt at peace.

There were tons of butterflies all over the road and in the grass today. It was mostly pleasant, but at points it was a little bit much. They left poop colored streaks on my arms as I collided with them. Pollen? This big wash appeared a couple of times throughout the ride.

A sign was pointing me to nowhere, but then I appeared at this dam where all the locals were swimming, drinking, and hanging. I had to stop for a short dip.

Duncan recommend that I explore the philosophy of ‚Äúeffective altruism‚Äù, so I listened to the first half of *The Life You Can Save* by Peter Singer.  This book is really resonating with me as it‚Äôs answering all of my doubts/questions in humanitarianism. I‚Äôm ready to do and give more. I‚Äôm excited to ride tomorrow just so I can finish the audiobook. Please, please, please listen/read this book.

I‚Äôve been starting to think more about what I am going to do when this is over. I honestly have no clue. I know that I‚Äôve been inspired to be outside more, to tinker with bikes again, and to give more, but I don‚Äôt know what that will look like while balancing a job. I don‚Äôt think I would like the lifestyle of an outdoor guide, but I also don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready for the desk again. Hmm ü§î
