The young route leaders and I were once named “The Young Mens Cycling Association”, but now that Natalya has joined the team, we switched to “The Young Mammals Cycling Association”. Along with our rebranding, we have finalized our daddy names.

| City, State | Birth Name | Daddy Name | Alpha Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Johnson City, TX | Duncan | Big Johnson City Daddy | Beta |
| Marfa, TX | Seth | Marfa Daddy | Beta Plus |
| Chattahoochee, FL | Natalya | Chattahoochee Daddy | Alpha |
| Silver City, NM | Cam | Silver Daddy | Charlie |

Our short stay in Mississippi is over and we are now in Alabama. Not a huge change in scenery as it’s just more Gulf Coast. I enjoy the beach and the Gulf, but I’m certainly more of a mountain guy. I keep dreaming of my next adventure, but winter is glooming over North America.

We stopped at this cool lighthouse and saw Jimmy Buffet’s childhood home in Pascagoula. 🤷

The destination for the day was Dauphin Island, so I checked out the beach and enjoyed the sunset before getting back to the church for red beans and rice. I really liked the beans so I’ll try to add the dish to my cooking repertoire.
