Today was the first Texas day. I‚Äôll be honest, I started the day with a preconceived notion of what Texas is, but within the first hour I rebooted my brain and took in the world around me. 

There was this super cool abandoned building on the side of the road, so my lizard brain told me ‚Äúyou should put your bike in the window, it‚Äôll be such a cool photo.‚Äù Turns out the photo is kinda lame and wind tends to knock things down. The only damage was a gouge in my leather seat and scratched up bars. I felt kinda stupid but once I was back and the bike it didn‚Äôt take long for me to enjoy the views.

I rode with Duncan for most of the day at an incredibly leisurely pace so we could goof around and enjoy the flats we got.

I don‚Äôt have any good photos of the Butte, but the smile it gave me will have to do.

Lots of good cycling high today which concluded with a great golden hour. My day was fantastically drama free, but I sense that was not the case for everyone else. Eh, just keep on swimming ü¶à
