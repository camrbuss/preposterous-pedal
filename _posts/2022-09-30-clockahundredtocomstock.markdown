I keep saying this, but today was filled with more fantastic cycling highs!

West Texas is awesome. Yeah I said it. I think the U.S. has some pretty freaking awesome geography and I couldn’t appreciate the Appalachian mountains without the flat areas of Texas.

It seems like the tiny towns exist just because of the jobs having to do with border patrol. There are these huge blimps and towers with cameras that scan the border. They probably have a close up of me peeing, but when you gotta go, you gotta go.

I would say 50% of the cars you see are border patrol cars. You also see three tires chained up together laying on the side of the road. Apparently they drag these tires around all the dirt roads and then check for footprints. It’s crazy how much effort and money goes into the whole operation.

Anyhow the riding was great and was the first Texas day where there were no mountains in the distance, just desert shrubs.

After some good conversation with Duncan about free will and faith, the Peco river appeared. As to not create the illusion that everything is perfect, I will note I had about a 20 minute period today were I was not a fan of myself, but I washed that icky feeling away by living in the present. 🌊🤢

The heat of the sun made today pretty challenging, but when I hit our destination at 90 miles I just had to turn around and get up to 100. I was jamming out to some music and had amazing pep in my pedal. I think the hours before sunset are always quite magical. Being on a bike for them also prevents the bugs from bothering me. I hope I continue to keep bicycles at the forefront of my life when this whole thing is over.

The end of the day was at a church, so it was shower time. Here I am peeping my head out to cheer on the last rider. 🎊

There was some petty conflict amongst the older adults in the team today, but I was out on the road while it occurred so I was immune to the contagious negative emotions. Hopefully a good nights rest will heal everyone’s woes. ☮️
