Today was a high BPM (Beats per Minute) kinda day. The countless dog chases and bumpin dance music made me feel alive. The aggressive Blue Heeler and Great Pyrenees were matched with the high energy [Boiler Room 2022 playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6ufMFa1kM46HMT8SBZClPx?si=TCVDpxGSR1evanfCqT9tkw). Lots of laughing with the dogs in the sprawling sugar cane farmland. Are dogs and bikes a scary combination because the dogs don‚Äôt see two wheeled vehicles very often? Are they just bored? I wish I could understand what is going through their brain as they bark and chase us down the road.

Last night it rained whilst camping in the state park, but the rain stopped just before getting up and the rain didn‚Äôt even make for an extremely humid day! I enjoyed the blue sky‚Äôs and soaked in the sun. How am I going to go back to living a life mostly indoors? How will I deal with the gloomy winter?

There were plenty of great roads to ride on today, so after the 70 mile rest stop at the local Dollar General, I decided to go out and back for some bonus miles to get me up to 102 miles for the day. So many good chemicals rushing through my body whilst spinning away! ‚ù§Ô∏èüö≤üåæ
