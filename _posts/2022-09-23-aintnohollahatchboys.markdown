The team finally “slept in” and didn’t leave right at sunrise. Annnnnd everyone stopped for breakfast! Our teams adventurous spirit is growing!

I’m not claiming to have been the cause of this change in spirit, but I can’t help but feel like I certainly influenced it. Why do I seek to influence others? Maybe I just like seeing others think for themselves instead of just following the crowd. Not to say following the crowd is a bad thing. I apologize that this paragraph had no conclusions, but I’m going to just leave it at that. 😕

So I’m riding through Hatch, NM which is a farming town for chilies and pecans. It’s a quaint place with a beautiful mix of American and Mexican food.

The Rio Grande looks really dry and dirty, but the pecan trees are enjoying the sweet life.

I went self-supported today so that I didn’t have to worry about going through the rest stops. This meant that I also got to ride with Duncan and we got to have some deep conversations. I really enjoy deep topics, but I typically don’t have much resolve at the end. It almost seems like the best way through life is to accept the chaotic torture of life. 🤷❔

The day ended in Las Cruces, a cool city, but I don’t think it is for me.

Lots of good emotions. Keep smiling!
