The first full day in Louisiana was an eye opening experience into what life is like in the Bayou.

The landscape seems to alternate between large stretches of industry, impoverished towns, and then wealthy housing. It’s tough for me to draw any meaningful conclusions, but it seems like the culture has a lot of depth.

Whilst the sporadic clouds and sporadic sun created a rather unpleasant sauna effect, I located a sticker of “Wolf Tit” that a cyclist had left 6 years prior.

After getting over the mental unpleasantries of today along with my first day of dripping sweat, I found myself enjoying the state park.

The day ended with a thunderous cloud of mosquitoes as the sunset on the lake. While sitting on the dock, Seth lit some candles and we had a voodoo celebration around his dead sunglasses. 🐍🕯

Thankful for the life I live.
