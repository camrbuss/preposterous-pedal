Another day where I just felt so high on dopamine for like the entire freaking day! Ugh, this can‚Äôt be sustainable?! How can pedaling bring me so much happiness? It can‚Äôt, but the people and the world around me sure can.

So ya know how I was complaining about my butt? Turns out the cheap Amazon cycling shorts are to blame. These Gucci shorts my sister got me made my saddle feel like a soft bed after a shower. Well, maybe not that good, but significantly better.

The day started out in the desert, but slowly turned into the urban sprawl of Phoenix. The morning was nice as I was fully hydrated and got to pee every 30 minutes on the side of the road while singing as loud as I wanted. One of the route leaders had an amazing remix song playing at one of the rest stops, hence the name for today. The beautiful sun created a smiling Cam:

This was from a previous day but I had to wait to tell the story. One character on the team cooked a team pasta dinner and insisted that you needed to soak the noodles before cooking, just like rice. There were some hesitant looks, but nobody stopped the individual. Dinner was served and what do you know, the pasta was the soggiest lump of flour you‚Äôve ever put into your mouth. The noodles were total mush and tasted starchy. My Italian grandfather definitely made a slight roll in his grave, but hopefully I can get his machinery up and running so it‚Äôs a good roll next time.

Okay, back to today‚Ä¶

When you gotta pee like crazy, you‚Äôve got to take a post-pee mirror selfie in the Walmart bathroom:

And then when you enter Phoenix which is full of strip malls, you‚Äôve got to get a hair cut using only sign language because your Spanish is so bad. But hey, I think it looks pretty good besides the copious amount of product. Please note this smile is right before having to change a flat tire caused by three different thorns.

Wow, so I kinda love the Phoenix area. It‚Äôs such a sprawl, but yet every bit of sprawl is still enjoyable. I went into this grungy looking bike shop and met the owner who was an absolute joy. The guy owned the store and sold mostly used gear. I was interested in this used brooks saddle the guy had, so I asked how much. He gave a number that was too high so I told him it was too much, he jumped on eBay and scrolled through giving me the saddle for less that I offered. We then chatted about how commercial bike shops sucked and he helped me change my second flat tire. He had the coolest air compressor tool where it could auto adjust for both presta and shrader valves. He told me he had made it! What an inspiration! I kinda want to start making custom bike parts for people‚Ä¶ I just need a house and a garage‚Ä¶ in due time‚Ä¶

With the saddle feeling even better than my shorts, I cruised through rich neighborhoods and smiled the entire way. Huge trees and lots of cyclists, just warmed my heart! üå¥üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü´∂

I finished up the ride wishing for more miles and more sunlight, but atleast I got to have some fun collecting all the signs the route leaders had put out.

Sorry for the non-contiguous ramblings today, but my brain doesn‚Äôt know how to handle this excitement and joy. What am I loving so much?!
