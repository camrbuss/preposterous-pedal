The roads were busy today but the bridges and wide shoulders made up for it. This critter was hanging out with me for one of my roadside breaks.

The Mississippi finally came into view after many miles of levees in previous days. The bridge view was nice, but the overwhelming car noise dulled the experience, so I’m hoping to take in more of the river experience in downtown Baton Rouge tomorrow.

My quick zip through downtown today exposed me to the tallest capital building in the U.S. which appears to be focused on the Louisiana Purchase.

On my way into the city, I got to pass through the economy fueling the city. No opinions, just a face…

I ended my day with some comforting phone time, which included watching movies. This quote struck a chord with me. Fyodor Dostoevsky writes, “The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to the point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him or around him and so looses all respect for himself and for others and for having no respect, he ceases to love”

Thanks everyone for the support!
