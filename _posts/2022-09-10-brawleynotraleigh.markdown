The day flew by! Not only did we start out with a long steady descent, but the team conversation was effortless and fun.

Last night we stayed within eyesight of the border, which is currently fashioned with a grated wall. Funny enough, there is little border patrol activity, but tomorrow we will go through a border patrol checkpoint whilst never leaving the U.S. The wall certainly makes it slightly more physically challenging to cross the border, but it seems like the main reason to cross a border is to experience the society on the other side, thus requiring a more formal entrance/exit.

Happy Cam on the descent. A mix of overcast skies, mist rolling off the mountain, and evidence of major flooding made the ride absolutely gorgeous.

We had a short shuttle on the interstate due to flooded roads, but the remainder of the days ride was flat and straight. You can tell that we are entering nothingness when they burn shit for power.
