I wish I got out of the church a little more today, but I definitely took a real rest day this time.

In the morning we got up earlyish and went to a diner. Yum, I  sure do love diner coffee. Unlimited refills! Then I went back to the church and laid in bed for a while.

I fixed a slow leak on my rear tire from a staple today, but honestly it was kind of fun again after not needing to fix a flat since Austin. ‚öôÔ∏èüõû

I got a call from my sister informing me that she got engaged today. Super exciting news that I‚Äôve been waiting to receive for months. I‚Äôll get to see them again in Blacksburg when my journey is over, but I hope that we will all live in close proximity for years to come. Lots of love, laughter, and friendship to be had!

The night ended with a team meeting where two older team members had to publicly apologize for being mean to each other. The bickering seems totally unnecessary to me and is very counterproductive to our mission, but I do understand that all emotions are valid and we just have to deal with them in a healthy manner. I hope the conflict has resolved, but at the time of writing this, that seems unlikely. 

Just keep on trucking to Mississippi (the state)!
