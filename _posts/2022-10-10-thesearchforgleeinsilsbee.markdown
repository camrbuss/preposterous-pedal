I rode through the Big Thicket National Preserve today. Lots of pine trees and straight roads. The riding goes by so fast when there isn’t much wind and the roads are straight and flat. Although I like climbing, there is something strangely pleasant about the constant mirage in the road whilst being shaded by the millions of trees.

Today was a physical and emotional roller coaster of good and bad feelings. I don’t think there was any one thing throwing me off, but a lot of my concerns are due to not knowing what others are thinking. Maybe the word “insecure” is fitting, but I don’t know what I’m insecure about. Maybe I can’t handle conflict well. I think I have the capacity to navigate tense situations, but I cannot seem to get over them very well. I guess I’m slow at moving on… Time is a great healing agent though ❤️‍🩹

Amongst the ups and down I still pulled out my best smile for the shameless selfie.

I’m continuing to think about how I want to spend my time once this trip is over. Traveling to the Southern Hemisphere and/or engaging with another nonprofit are the two leading ideas.
