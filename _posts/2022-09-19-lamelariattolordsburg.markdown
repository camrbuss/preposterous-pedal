I had another great day with the same unreal highs throughout the day. I freaking love riding bikes. It just seems like such an intense and long lasting dopamine release. I will say the joy quickly disappears anytime I am in the vicinity of an individual with the amount of negative energy greater than a black hole. I am getting better at not letting this affect me, but the solution is avoidance, which feels more like a bandaid.

The morning started with the pastor of the church we stayed at joining us for the first 10 miles of the ride. I had a couple opportunities to converse, but it just didn’t feel right, so I went off by myself. Since there wasn’t much civilization around for todays ride, I did the usual sitting at the rest stops for a long time and the zipping on up to the next one.

The road was so straight and empty that I played the how many things can I take off game. I have to wear my helmet, so this is the best I could come up with at the time.

While bored in the saddle, I also decided to readjust my shorts for optimal tanning. If only cyclist tan lines could be attractive

There was a pretty good head wind and I sensed some competitiveness in myself and others, so my legs are a tad sore tonight 😮‍💨. The motto is “ride your ride”, so I’ll do my best to enjoy the now.

Tensions are growing amongst the team, but there is enough “chill” energy to keep things intact. I’ve been deemed the “easiest going guy in the group” by one member. I’ll try to embody that.

Super excited for the climb into Silver City tomorrow!
