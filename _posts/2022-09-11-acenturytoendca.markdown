Best day I’ve had in a while! So much fun!

The plan for the day was 93 miles, so I started the day preparing for the potential death march, but was greeted by ever changing awesomeness. My day was three sets of three different things. Farming, sand dunes and mountains. Alone time, Marese time, and Beverly time. Clouds, rain, and full sun. My brain loved every stage and the transition between stages. The scenery was amazing and the people were great. The Bike the US for MS support team is amazing and kept all of us hydrated all day long!

I realized today that I’ve been so caught up in the fear of getting soaked that I forgot how fun getting wet is. Obviously it helps that I know the sun will dry me in hours and there is a 0% chance of hypothermia, but maybe that’s the beginning of my love/hate relationship with the desert.

Gosh, why do I love the desert so much? It’s sucks the life out of you, but something about your existence in it is just so freeing. I sure felt free peeing on the road, in the sand, or on the bike. There aren’t even deer to judge me!

I will say around 3pm the 100 degree sun really got to me and I was starting to see the effects of heat exhaustion. After a quick McDanks ice cream I was back on the road and taking on some extra miles to get a full century. So funny that I started the day at 10 mph, but ended close to 20 mph. I guess it means I didn’t go out too hard, but tomorrow will be the real test.


Anyways, I guess photos are worth a thousand words:

Oh, and I got through the audiobook of “The Time Machine “ by HG wells. Cool listen 🎧 ⏰ 

Also I finished reading “The Subtle Art of not giving a Fuck”. Phenomenal read that I will remember for a while. Would recommend!
