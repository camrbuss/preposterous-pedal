Day 47! It‚Äôs all coming to an end too soon. I‚Äôve got the Sunday blues.

I don‚Äôt know what is next for my physical body, but today I realized that my next spiritual step in life is working to destroy my ego. If you‚Äôve got any reading/listening recommendations please send them my way.

I got on my bike a little late this morning (8am) because it was another cool morning, but at least I got to chill at the church and sip lots of coffee. Because Seth, Natalya, and I got started so much later than the main group, we waived the need for the rest stop van. It was great because we got to enjoy convenience stores at our own pace, which meant I got to drink coffee while sitting in a rocking chair.

The scenery in Florida is pleasant, but not crazy interesting. The most eventful thing was watching a boar spot me and then sprint away. üêóüí®

I made today a century by turning north and crossing the Florida-Georgia line. A bonus state done on bonus miles. Lots of ranch style homes flying Trump flags next to a reservoir managed by the Army Corps of Engineers.

Random Idea: In todays relatively material world we all find different ways to show others we care about them. I want to give to those in need, but when I want to give to whom have their basic needs met, I would like to give ‚Äúcoffee dates‚Äù. The only issue is not everyone loves coffee, but that can usually be solved with tea or a pastry. I also think video call coffee dates are an equivalent substitute.
