I woke up to voices of old southern women whispering to each other while preparing breakfast. My brain was not ready for their kind ignorance that early in the morning, but I did get a kick out of them laughing at our “thong bicycle saddles”.

I rode todays 44 mile ride by myself so I could listen to some audio and enjoy the country roads before Tallahassee. The introspection was needed before the overwhelmingly busy  FSU campus.

We are staying at the [Tallahassee Bicycle House](http://bicyclehouse.org/) which has an amazing mission to serve the local community without forcefully attempting to instill values. It was inspiring talking to the organizers of the (ware)house about their goals and fears.

After most of the team went to bed, the daddies went to a vegan bar called “Bark” and watched two metal bands play. The fries were good, the music was ok, but the experience was great.

I’ve already started to entertain some job options after the trip and am incredibly conflicted with location. I feel like my parents are really good at convincing me to stay in Virginia with sayings like “what about your chickens” and “what about the machine tools”. These make me feel guilty, but I’d rather be told that my family wants me to be close so they can see me. I want to be in Virginia, but it feels like if I have highly specific job criteria, the chances of a job being in Southwest Virginia are very small. Plus I already know the pains of traveling across the country by bike, car, truck, and plane. Duncan said I should conclude this paragraph with “I want to grow beyond the chicken coop and spread my wings and fly”, but I’m trying to take my life seriously while this buttface is giving me chicken shit advice. 🏠🐓💩😂
