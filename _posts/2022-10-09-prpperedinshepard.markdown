Today was a fantastic 80 mile ride through Eastern Texas. It’s been incredible to see how fast the landscape transitioned from desert to trees. There is no mountain range that creates the separation, but after leaving Austin there has been plenty of rivers, trees, and grass. The change is welcome as the frequency of small towns has greatly increased.

We rode through National Forest, which felt like the first time since New Mexico. It seems like Texas has mostly private lands, but it’s a huge state and I have only explored a fraction of it.

The highlight of the day was where we stayed. It was a community of buildings all with their own theme as well as a main building for socializing. It’s a family run business of uncle/aunts and had so much love and personality. There were a lot of cats as well, so I got my monthly dose of purrs.

No major personal journey epiphany’s today, but maybe that’s due to the increase in team drama.
