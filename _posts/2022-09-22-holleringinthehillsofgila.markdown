I know I keep saying this, but this adventure is giving the highest of highs. A previous years route leader joined us on todays ride and related to my feelings, noting the addictive nature of adventure cycling. In particular he mentioned how lame normal rides are where you finish at the same place you started. I agree with him and always have.

Seth and I started the day together and ended the day together. Great companionship! We met up with Duncan at the first rest stop and snagged a photo. 👨‍👦‍👦

Todays ride was the last of the mountains. We road out of Silver City through Gila National Forest and up and over Emory Pass. 5,000’ of ascent over 75 miles. Fun, but I still could have used more climbing. I will say the Gila wilderness was top notch.🌲⛰ I’m totally in love with New Mexico.

The pass was amazing with a view of the landscape below showing no other mountain anywhere close to its height.

The day ended with a jump in the reservoir and lots of smiles. I just love how the afternoon sun is so good at drying everything off. Oh desert, why are you so magical but also mean?

Another day where I continuously felt like there was no place I’d rather be or no other activity I would enjoy more. Thanks to everyone who has kept me sane enough so that I have the opportunity to do this.
