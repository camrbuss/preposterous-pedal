Phew was it a cold one today. Waking up to 37F was tough, but I immediately went to a coffee shop and spent 3 hours watching movies on my phone.

After the temp warmed up to about 50, I got on the bike and climbed up this beautiful bridge with the sun feeding my soul. Such good vibes!

I put in my ear buds and gave my friends and family a call while biking the empty boardwalk. It was nice talking to everyone, but it’s clear that I don’t really know what I want to do after the trip is over, but I am certainly thirsty for more adventure.

I stopped into the O’Keefe museum welcome center just to be let down after a kind woman explained that the museum was not for Georgia O’Keeffe, but for a potter. I then went into a different potters show room and felt the judgement pouring out of all the older southern women in the showroom. I wanted to buy a long sleeve shirt because I was cold, but I couldn’t bare the idea of supporting a shop I don’t like. Consumers have a vote!

The day ended at a park as the fall colors began to pop with the sun lower in the sky.
