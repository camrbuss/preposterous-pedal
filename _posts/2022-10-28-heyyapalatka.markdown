I really like riding my bike. 91 miles goes by so fast when you smile and listen to music. 

Tim, Seth, and I started our day in the rear and stopped at McDonald’s for breakfast. It was so nice having a calm morning, sipping coffee, with simple conversation.

The day was gloomy and rainy, but the drama amongst the old women on the team turned up to 11 today. I avoided pretty much all the incidents, but gossip tells me there was some yelling over petty crap fueled by peoples search for “fairness”. I still like the phrase pounded in my head as a kid, “Life ain’t fair”. Maybe my new companion, Meducy, has been protecting me.

I really had fun riding in the rain, but I’m not so sure if I would have had as good an attitude if we had to camp outside tonight. The humidity just makes everything so sticky.

After finishing the ride, we ate pizza at the church, then went to Huddle House for our second dinner, and then concluded the night with key lime pie in the Publix parking lot. The daddies made the best of a hard day by jamming out to Britney Spears on our sugar high. 🍰🕺
