I was going to true up my wheels this morning, but I decided not to as I didn’t want one of the characters on the team to start messing with my bike without my permission. Oh well, at least I am inspired to get involved with a local nonprofit bike repair shop.

I accidentally left my shorts and underwear in the bathroom this morning, but didn’t realize until we were at camp. I was proud of myself for not thinking about it for very long as there is nothing I can do. Maybe this graffiti inspired my mood.

The riding today was exceptional with quiet roads and minimal debris. The small towns that we ride through in Florida don’t have a specific vibe, but I get some older feelings.

I’m trying to be more comfortable with silence in conversation, but the daddies and I were pretty chatty at the last rest stop of the day. We were jamming out to the two good Weezer albums.
