In an effort to recover both mentally and physically I won’t write much today, and what I do write will be random.

I wanted to buy some rainbow unicorn cycling socks today, but I chose not to as I really don’t need them.

I saw this piece of art today that struck a chord with me.

I also saw this cool creature that got me grooving at a coffee shop.

I finished “Chasing the Squirrel” today and have begun “Alan Turing: The Engima”.
