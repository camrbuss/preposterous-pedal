Today was another super high energy, super happy, and super excited day. I don’t know what it is, but getting up to get on a bike with absolutely no plans is just the best feeling in the world. I rode with our new route leader out of the city and it was such a joy as she clearly has good bike handling and city riding experience. Thanks for the candid photo Natalya!

Soon after leaving the city we had to ride over a long bridge with no shoulder and a lot of debris. Riding over the debris felt like one of those war movies where there are hundreds of bullets wizzing by, but somehow the character doesn’t get hit. I didn’t get a flat, but I heard constant glass breaking under my tires as semi’s wizzed by about a foot away. I don’t want all my riding to be like that, but it sure got my adrenal glands pumping in a pleasant way.

Next came calm roads with spaced out beach homes and cool bridges. I caught up to Duncan and then we began our silly conversations while riding over bridges.

Unfortunately there was one bridge on route that is closed due to disrepair, so the vans had to shuttle us around the bridge. The only plus to being shuttled was seeing the NASA Stennis Space Center from the interstate. Of course I wanted to go, but the group seems to be more focused on getting to the end.

Towards the end of the ride the cold front was really hitting, so I didn’t want to spend much time at the beach.

I’ve realized that I am avoiding negative people in a selfish attempt to keep my positive mental attitude. Is that wrong? Can I do this and be more kind?
