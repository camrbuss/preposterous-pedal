I don‚Äôt think I want to live in a place where the grocery store has a passcode for the bathroom.    Maybe the area just needs to be socially liberal, or maybe the population needs to be lower. I‚Äôm not sure, but I do know I was doing the pee dance while attempting self checkout and desperately asking the associate for the passcode.

My off day in Tempe has been good, but is underwhelming when compared to yesterday. There‚Äôs something special about being on a bike and only having one goal for the day. I set some goals for myself like shopping and going to the ASU Art Museum, but the goal of resting kinda dulled everything out.

This cool architecture design at the art museum caught my eye as well as some ceramic cups made with Native American techniques.

I will say I got a major thrill out of chasing the mobile food delivery robot around campus.

This evening we visited the Barrow Neurological Institute and donated fundraising money for MS treatment. It is hard to hear about what patients go through, but also uplifting to hear about all the progress we have made in the treatment of MS.

Tomorrow will likely be one of the hardest days of the trip with lots of climbing over 87 miles. I‚Äôm sure it will be hard, but I am super excited to be going up in the mountains. I‚Äôve been asked to help the route leaders and sweep. I enjoy the challenge of slowing down, but I will say it‚Äôs more of a challenge of timing because I don‚Äôt want to leave too late so that the rest stop vans are waiting for me. My stead awaits üê™
