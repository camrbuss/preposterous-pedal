Today was a 90% bike path day and normally I don’t love bike paths due to the heavy pedestrian traffic, but todays path was up on the levee and was great to ride on. Who knew oil could be this fun and the river could highlight such cool junk!

After finishing up the ride, we took the cable car into the French Quarter. Bourbon street is such a zoo! All in all it was too touristy for me, but I completed my experience by getting a daiquiri, listening to buskers, and eating a poboy. The outskirts of the tourism were way better!

I think I’ve reached the point where my travel desires have began to dry up, but my thirst for riding bikes has just gotten a taste. Louisiana is just about to run out of road for my hungry gams.

Onto MS tomorrow!
