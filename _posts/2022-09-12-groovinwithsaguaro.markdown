Tough start of the day, but amazing afternoon!

I woke up and went outside to grab my shirt and jersey that I left outside to dry, to find that someone stole my jersey. The jersey that I got when I was probably 14 🙁. I was annoyed at myself and society, but I tried to remind myself that hopefully the person that took it needed it more than me. 

Off I went on my bike with about 35 miles on interstate 10. The views were good, but the road debris and road noise was quite unpleasant. Wanting to be off the bike, I just decided to speed through the day.

Luckily the second half of the day was on single lanes road and I got to enjoy the saguaro cactus 🌵. This sign at a convenience store also cheered me up.

Just as the heat was cranking up, a storm blew in and we got a little rain, this cooled things off and the rest of the evening was a perfect temperature. The people who got a hotel for the night really missed out.

A couple of us went off-road in the desert for a bit of adventure. I went off on my own for a bit and this felt like the thing to do.

Maybe I like combining things that “shouldn’t” work well together, or maybe I’m just strange… oh well. No flat tires or thorns in the ass.

All in all I am feeling strong. Legs are a bit sore and my butt hurts, so I shaved my butt. That crease between your gluteus maximus and your leg was getting irritated, so I strategically shaved it and applied petroleum jelly. Maybe that will ease the pain, but I’m prepared for it to get worse 🤷🧈
