Probably the lowest day of the ride both in elevation and mental state. Duncan and I spent the day discussing and climbing the battles of dealing with conflict, finding purpose, and staying excited.

We tootled around all morning and after peeking up on the levee, the sun persuaded us to hang out in the Dollar General parking lot for a while. Pringles, chili, and a roll of cookies later we were back on the road.

I think we both ran out of energy towards the end of the 62 mile ride or maybe we just hit such a low that we had to repeatedly tell each other what we are thankful for. We ended the day at church with some cheer and hopes for a better day in New Orleans.

Random “conclusion” of the day: Richmond might be my next place to move, but I’m still contemplating.
