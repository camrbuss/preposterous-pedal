As per my usual rest days, I try to keep my writings to a minimal.

I woke up at 8! Phew! Amazing!

I ate a bunch of food in the morning and explored the UT Austin campus and engineering buildings. Compared to Virginia Tech, there are no displays of engineering work in all the engineering buildings. Maybe I have some school pride? Here is a picture of a cool unused lab in the energy engineering building.

I had a moment of clarity after walking around in that I don’t want to go back to grad school right now. I think I’d be more excited about learning on my own and/or through work. The campus did have a cool mirror art installation though.

I went to grab a coffee off campus and accidentally ended up on the bottom floor of a student housing building that had the atmosphere of a fancy hotel. Kinda cool but I imagine it’s pretty darn expensive. I sat there for two hours watching a movie on my phone.

I ended the day wandering downtown via bicycle, which satisfied my desire to be back on the bike. I think I might be hooked on riding.
