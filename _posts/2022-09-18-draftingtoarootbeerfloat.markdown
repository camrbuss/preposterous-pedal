Everyone in the group seemed to get back into the groove of things today. No riders got in the van today and the entire group didn’t spread out any more than 30 minutes from each other. This was much needed as some of the older people had trouble with their phones yesterday, when communication was imperative.

I played the game of sitting at each rest stop until the last rider came through and then getting back on the bike to see how many people I could catch. I would have preferred to go off and explore, but today was pretty desolate. That’s not to say the mountains and valleys weren’t stunning.

Keeping beetles as a theme of the blog. This creature may or may not have been eating others of their same kind.

Since today had some slightly monotonous sections, I was trying to come up with fun pictures to take. This is not my best work, but it’s a starting point.

At the last rest stop of the day the Taylor Freeze ice cream shop gave us all free root beer floats!

If anyone was personally invested in the health of my buttocks, they told me today that they are still tired, but are healing from the mutiny of my previous saddle. It’s worth noting the my right cheek had a lot more attitude in the discussion. Additionally, my ears informed me that they were irritated from old people arguing with Siri, but I shoved in some ear buds and then they settled down.

Great day with good vibes 😎
