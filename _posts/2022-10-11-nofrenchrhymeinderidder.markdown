What a wonderful day on the bike! I really like riding bikes. It’s just so great to be in control of your path on the road and have the wind in your face. 

Seth and I went self supported today so I didn’t see any of the other riders all day. Great way to give everyone space and soak in all that the local convenience stores have to offer.

At one roadside pee break I ran down to the drainage ditch, and then mid stream, I realized there was a spicy looking spider about a foot in front of my chest. We all kept calm and finished our business.

Now that we are out of Texas I can finally give an honest recap. I enjoyed riding through Texas, but the only area I would ever need to revisit would be “hill country”. Okay, now onto the fun of the Bayou!

Probably one of my fastest riding days with an average over 15 mph, but every moment of it was comfortable and fun. An added bonus to end the day was using the local libraries blazing  fast internet. 🔥📠
