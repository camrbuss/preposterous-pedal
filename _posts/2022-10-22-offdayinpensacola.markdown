Todays off day wasn’t really needed as the flat land and low mileage days are nothing compared to the desert days earlier in this trip.

Because we are staying near University of West Florida, a few of us decided to check out the UWF single track trails. We all had a lot of fun playing around on the sandy flat trails with our gravel bikes. Kinda makes sense that real mountain biking needs mountains, because I don’t even know how you would build a difficult trail here.

A couple members of the team have been talking about how much they like the riding in the southeast compared to the southwest, but I honestly miss the challenges of the southwest. Riding here is so risk free that you don’t have to plan your ride or even push your body to get through to the end of the day. I miss the suffering that made the evenings so rewarding. I miss being able to jump in a body of water and then dry out in an hour. But, I sure do love all the foliage around here ☺️ 

Random thought: I want to give weight lifting a serious try.

Random question: Why do we stay at so many churches? Why not mosques, synagogues, or other religious buildings?

Random travel idea: Motorbike ride through Mexico via Arkansas and Oklahoma.
