This morning was freaking cold!

After waking up in a goat head infested campground where you have thorns stuck to your shoes and you have to carry your bike to the road, I got on the road with a smile!

The Texas weather seems to be pretty consistent. Cold mornings and then a quick rise in temperature causing steady easterly winds. This means the morning miles are easy, but everything else just feels like a steady uphill. It’s honestly pretty good riding though. I’m so glad I’m rocking 38mm wide tires for the chip seal roads. The big shoulders allow for lots of dancing, singing, and yelling on the bike. Plus you get to pee wherever you like.

I got to the campground around 1pm, which allowed for lots of food, rest, and reading!

Apparently Marathon, TX is one of the best star gazing locations in the U.S. housing a couple Texas University’s telescopes. I just love seeing the Milky Way. 🔭🌚🪐
