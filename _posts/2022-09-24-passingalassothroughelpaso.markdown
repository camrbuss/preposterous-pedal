The main group of riders did the Anthony Gap alternate route that skips over El Paso, but Seth and I decided to follow the main route and meet up with the group at the end of the day.

I was prepared for busy roads, but it really wasn‚Äôt too bad. I enjoyed going through the city after spending so much time in the middle of nowhere. Coming out of Las Cruces I must have seen close to 100 cyclists in the pecan farmlands. I got waves from about 50% of the riders, but I got one peace sign, so my day was made.

El Paso had incredible bus transportation and a nice park, but lots of the historic downtown seemed to be vacant. Cool place though!

This artwork was made of reused plastic (trash cans, play-sets, tubing, barricades, etc.). This kind of art is my favorite!

Towards the end of the ride we saw the bridge to Mexico as well as the wall. I‚Äôm not sure what my expression is communicating in the picture, but I think I was amazed that it appeared as though the bridge was a daily commute for many.

So much love for everyone on this planet. I‚Äôm super grateful to be able to experience this trip.
The joy and excitement continues to flow!

Oh and I got a cycling hat from this store yesterday. Major upgrade to my kit as it really helps keep ambient light from spilling past my glasses. My dad is super picky about his sunglasses, but I‚Äôm thinking maybe he needs a cool helmet with an embedded hat to keep the sun at bay. ‚òÄÔ∏èüï∂

My next upgrade is going to be some shorter cut cycling shorts to maximize my Vitamin-D intake. üçë
