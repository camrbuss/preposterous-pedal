Disclaimer - It’s taken me an extra day to reflect and write this one.

The morning of the last day was pretty somber. After some of the older women on the trip repeatedly chose to bicker with each other instead of distancing themselves, the women collectively made the drama so bad it forced a member to leave the group on the second to last day. We had 24 hours left to pretend to be a functioning team, but peoples egos just had to get in the way. The most upsetting part was the people who were involved just went around acting like nothing happened. The daddies were probably the most upset and retreated to only necessary communication with the rest of the team. We were “disappointed fathers”.

The ride into the finish was rainy, but it was still fun. I got some ride time with Seth and Natalya during the last miles before meeting up with the team. Everyone rode together for the last 7 miles to the beach in the pouring rain. After the team picture, I jumped into the ocean. The stormy weather made for some great bodysurfing. 🌊

After celebrating with snacks, we hung out in the hotel room and concluded the night. There was an overwhelming feeling of relief. The organization guided cyclists all the way around the US in 2022 without any serious injuries!

I don’t think I believe that anyone should try to change another person, but I do believe there is some validity in guiding someone. Is it worth trying to guide people that aren’t looking to change their perspective? Is it even possible? So many people have guided me throughout my life and I am so thankful. If it wasn’t for the guidance from friends and family I would continue to make many of the mistakes I’ve already made. The support and encouragement I received is incredible. Thank you!

Although this post started slightly negative, this has been one of the best experiences of my life. I don’t want to say “I found myself”, but I certainly gave myself the time and space to find the values that are the most important to me. I want to give my time, I want to give monetarily, I want to spread peace and love, I want bicycles to be a focus, and I want to be more spiritual.

I encourage everyone to take some significant time away from “everyday life” and embark on an adventure of their choosing. Although biking across the US may seem like a physical journey, I think it’s much more of a spiritual one. Stay open minded and thanks for reading! ✌️❤️🚲
