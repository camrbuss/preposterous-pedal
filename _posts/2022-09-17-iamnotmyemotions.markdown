I just read a book teaching me how to only care about what is important, and I am listening to ‚ÄúMeditations‚Äù by Marcus Aurelius, yet I felt like an upset teenager today.

Let‚Äôs say hypothetically that there is an individual that fulfills all their duties, but does so with such a negative attitude that it damages everyone around them. Let‚Äôs also make an assumption that this individual is close-minded and is unwilling to change. How do you best improve the situation? (I‚Äôm genuinely looking for advice, so send it my way if you‚Äôve got some)

It seems like this same hypothetical situation occurs in corporate culture all to often, causing younger people to flee in search for other work. In order to improve my quality of life, I need to learn how to improve this type of situation without feeling like a teenager. I will work on this üìà

Okay, back to bicycles 

Beautiful early morning ride with views of lake Roosevelt

Next off was some nice climbing with beautiful views

I decided pretty early in the ride that I was going to go self supported for the rest of the day so that I could explore areas and not check in with the rest stop van or hold up other riders. This allowed me to explore the Besh Ba Gowah archeological site whilst the sun was at its peak.

Turns out the site was protected some years ago on my birthday!

I finished up the day ascending and then descending Skyline Dr in Globe, AZ

Okay back to my social problems 

I think the key to working with all sorts of people is open communication facilitated by a calm and un-assuming tone. Okay, bye! ‚úåÔ∏è
