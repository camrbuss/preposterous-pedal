Great day on the saddle putting us another 75 miles closer to Austin!

Lots of cows, goats, sheep, and donkeys on the ride today.

There were signs all over declaring the area “Trump Country”. I thought we were in the United States? Did I cross a border?

On a more serious note, today was the first day where I felt that the locals had some negative feels towards others. Signs like “Democrats are destroying America” or the guy that couldn’t even acknowledge my existence after I let him get in front of me at the Subway line. Or the guy at the dollar store who asked me why I was getting nail polish where I lied with “patching the paint on my bike”. Maybe I just had a bad viewing lens on today, or maybe the integrity of Lyndon Johnson’s childhood home is fading. I didn’t let it get to me too much, but it just felt like this world is too beautiful to be filled with negative feelings towards others. 😖

The married couple on my team owns a nail salon so Ann doctored up my nails to cheer me up. I’m hoping others will paint their nails to draw attention to why we ride. Can you see my glove tan?

I was also cheered up when my friends sent me a picture of my chickens eggs 🥚!

Shout out to my sister being born on this day many years ago! She inspires me to enjoy bikes, life, and others. ❤️
