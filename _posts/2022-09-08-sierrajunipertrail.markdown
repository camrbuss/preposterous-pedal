The first day was a lot of fun and one of the few days with some cherished climbing. I forgot what it is like to ride in groups larger than three people, but quickly remembered that it is miserable and dangerous. It’s also obnoxiously slow.

I love groups of two or three with good conversation, but most of my day was filled with rambling to myself and chanting street names.

I met a cyclist today that is doing the SoTier by himself with the support of his 19 year old son. The man was riding for his wife who died of cancer. I wish him luck on his journey, and pedal assisted bike 😜🏜🚴

I honestly love the desert, but the sun really does suck the energy out of you. After a restoring evening at a church, I’m super excited for some miles in the rain tomorrow.

Ending with a happy smile:
