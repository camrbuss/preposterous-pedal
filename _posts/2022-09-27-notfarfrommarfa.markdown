Can someone explain my spending habits? I’m buying the cheapest canned foods I can find, yet I’m happy to spend 5 dollars on coffee and 10 dollars for an artsy pin. I don’t get it.

Todays ride was pretty tough as it was 75 miles on a chip seal road without any services. Although I was looking down for the wind gusts, when I did look up, the views were stunning.

There was a cool art exhibit in the middle of nowhere which was a taste of the art scene in Marfa.

Then Marfa appeared from the endless fields of grass!

Imagine a country town invaded my hipster artists. That’s Marfa. I had a ton of fun going to galleries, coffee shops, mechanics shops, and a vegan restaurant. I didn’t snag any good photos, but it was a memorable experience. It made me really think about what makes a persons persona “real” or “fake”. I don’t think people are fake when they switch up their style. I like to think they’ve been stylistically “repressed” and are now being their true self. Stay weird people!

Side note, my bike is getting pretty dirty, but why would I clean it? Am I just lazy? Would it be fun being a bicycle mechanic? These are the questions that keep my mind busy.

I’m excited for tomorrows ride and looking forward to reading my new book. I tried starting a biography of Alan Turing, but I just didn’t get sucked in, so I bought a book on Mac Miller. The cross stitch I’ve been working on is tough to pick up because I’m often to tired to push thread around. My goal is to finish the cross stitch by Florida though. Boring update, but I felt like I needed to write it down so I hold myself accountable.
