Today was a tough morning after waking up with a headache. I kept mis diagnosing how I got the headache, but finally concluded it was falling off the top of my sleeping pad throughout the night. The constant forehead and sight pain faded throughout the ride as I ate lots of snacks and worked out my neck. This crappy selfie represents the state of my brain at the time.

We are in hill country, so after weaving through a wealthy neighborhood, there was a super steep hill that got my heart rate and spirit up.

Immediately upon entering the city area, Seth and I went to Barton Springs for a nice swim. Hopefully I didn’t disturb the endangered salamander species while I dove to the bottom. 🦎

Next up was coffee, vegan food truck, and some mural’s.

We went into one bike shop which had clearly been bought out by Trek and therefore had low accessories stock and high price tags. Then we stopped in to Austin Tri-Cyclist, which was an awesome triathlon and bike shop. I got some short inseam cycling shorts and two new tires as my current tires are falling apart. 🛞🩳

Duncan, Seth, and I spent the night walking around the city exploring the bats at the bridge, Magnolia Diner, Murals, donuts, and all the window shopping ATX has to offer.  The “Y’all is for all” slogan is all over the shop windows.

I get to sleep in tomorrow! 😴
