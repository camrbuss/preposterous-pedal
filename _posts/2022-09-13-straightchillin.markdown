Not a super exciting day today, but a good one.

Lots of big views that almost looked Andean and I got to eat a prickly pear fruit at a roadside market. Delicious!

Happy riding while jamming out to Frank Ocean. The only real discomfort today is my butt. Iâ€™m definitely starting to form some skin irritated areas and sitting in chairs is no longer comfortable. We shall see how many days until blisters ðŸ«£
