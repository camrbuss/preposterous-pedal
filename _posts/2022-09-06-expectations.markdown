This marks the start of my GitHub Pages Biking Blog, but don’t have expectations for what this will turn into, because I certainly don’t. 

My only goal is to write something every day of the journey. I’ll try to capture my thoughts and maybe a couple photos, but I doubt I will have much more than random thoughts.

In order to test my image display skills I present to you a beautiful beetle with amazing strength and route finding abilities.

And a photo of me all ready to rumble…

Oh, and maybe I’ll rant about stuff for a minute…

Gear is such a wild thing. It’s always something you never need more of, but are always tricked into thinking you need. Maybe the point of life is to just keep increasing the “standard of living” with more tools, or maybe it’s just to experience life with what you have.

I tried to keep my kit minimal and modest, but I know I have too much stuff. I recently read an article on “under-riding” which is the concept of riding trails with a bike that isn’t quite capable for the trail, but can still make it. I hope I can emulate some “under-riding” in my trip.

Okay, onto what I am actually bringing:

Gear:
Tent
Down bag
Inflatable pad and pillow 
White gas stove
Small pot
Spork
Silicon bowl
Headlamp
Books
Dry bag
Helmet
Ear buds
Sun glasses
Garmin Edge
Surly Straggler bike
Rear pannier 

Clothes:
Down jacket
Rain jacket
2 underwear 
3 socks (I guess 6 in reality)
2 shorts
2 shirts
2 riding shorts
2 riding jerseys 
2 riding socks
