I left this morning about 20 min after everyone else with a mission to stay a good distance behind the last rider. This goal didn‚Äôt last long as I quickly hit some teammates that were turned around in the grid of streets. I was hoping this would occur much later in the ride, but I got to stare at the road while spinning along. Does anyone know what the point is of speed bumps with gaps for car tires?

I don‚Äôt get the speed bumps, but I probably could have used some more speed consuming devices today. I just don‚Äôt know how to ride super slow. Like how can I be in my third to easiest gear while on a flat section? It just feels unstable. Anyways, I helped guide the slower riders in multi lane left turns, which eventually got us on backroads going around a mountain. Since I struggle riding slowly and I didn‚Äôt want to be breathing down peoples neck, I ate an apple under a desert bush. üçéüå±

I loved seeing all the road and mountain bikers on the outskirts of Tempe, but we eventually turned off on route 87, which is a highway from hell. The truck and trailer traffic was very intense and the side of the road was littered with debris and desert grass. The road noise alone gave me a headache, not to mention the beating sun and scorched earth around me. At one point I saw a diesel truck swerve through traffic just to roll coal on my teammate.  Nonetheless I was in love with my newly acquired saddle. (Am I using ‚ÄúNonetheless‚Äù correctly? Doubtful)

To be honest it was a pretty rough day, but a good one. I haven‚Äôt felt tested physically on this trip, but I guess that‚Äôs a product of being raised in a family who takes you on long, steep, rides when you are 14. I was mentally at my limit though. Our entire group got really spread out causing the drivers of the support vans to be a lot more stressed and we had riders dropping out throughout the day. Being the sweeping rider, it was disappointing seeing people tap out as I really want everyone to make it to the end of the day on their bike. Oh well, better to stay safe.

I hit the road at 6am and made it to the church at the end of the day at 6:30pm. Certainly the longest and slowest day on a bicycle that I‚Äôve ever experienced. I kept my spirits up though, even when searching for someone‚Äôs lost phone on the side of the road with trucks zooming by.

The last 12 miles of the 87 mile day were pure bliss. We finally got on a single lane road and the golden hour was at its peak, illuminating Tonto Basin. Even in the middle of nowhere, Arizona DOT decided to remove the mountain instead of going over it.

While I personally look forward to all of the mountain climbs in the future, the climbing days do seem to disperse the group and increase stress levels.

Just a reminder to myself that staying calm and loving is key to a positive experience for myself and the people around me. ü•∞
