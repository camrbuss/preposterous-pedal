Yet another fantastic ride and afternoon! I love climbing rocks and climbing on bikes.

As usual, everyone woke up way too early. I certainly understand the restless sleep due to sore legs, but it seems like we could all take 15 more minutes to meditate in our tents before beginning deconstruction. Oh well, I just hopped on my bike right at sunrise and rode by myself on the 45 mile ascent to Silver City, NM.

As you can see from my crystal clear map picture, we are in mountain territory.

I noticed at a rest stop that my bikes paint matches the sage brush. My bike now has a name, “Sage”.

I passed the “beginning” of the CDT (Continental Divide Trail) and saw lots of off-road touring cyclists. Doing the CDT via bicycle is certainly near the top of my adventure list now.

Silver City is such an amazing place. It’s got lots of history surrounded by art, bikes, and the university. Nestled in the mountains it gets about 15” of rainfall per year so it does not rely on reservoirs, but is economically supported by huge copper mines.

All good in the Gila! 🏜⛰🚵‍♀️
