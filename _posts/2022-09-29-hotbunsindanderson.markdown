Great riding today! I feel like I have my bike and routine dialed in. No complaints besides the constant battle to keep air inside my tubes/tires. How many miles are bike tires meant to last? How many patches is too many?

I’ve been nursing along a slow leak in my front tire for a couple of days wondering which of the three patches are causing me grief. Waking up to a flat tire is kind of thrilling because I just pump it up and see how long it lasts me. Maybe the cold morning allowed me to get more air molecules in the tube. 🤷

About two hours into the ride I stopped at a bridge to mend my ~5psi tire. Pretty quickly a blue Silverado pulls a U-turn and parks off the road. I’m thinking “Remain calm, they probably like cyclists and are just checking in”. Thankfully I was correct as the jacked ~30 year old dude walks up wearing a Texas shirt. He quickly informed me that he was the sheriff and just wanted to make sure I was OK. I pulled out my best small talk and assured him it was a routine flat fix. At this point my cycling shorts were rolled up to my inseam and I was rocking my new pin from Marfa. Not that the sheriff wasn’t nice, I just didn’t want to test the Texas stereotype.

With no political connotation, this place has the most law enforcement I’ve ever seen for the middle of nowhere. Take airport security and multiply it by two. The state trooper was wearing camouflage and carrying an extra magazine of rifle ammunition. Kinda strange when all the immigration stories I’ve heard revolve around saving peoples lives from the natural elements. 🤷

We are staying at a lovely church tonight where the hosts are the town’s judge and teacher. The town is tiny, but the local cactus hike was super cool.
