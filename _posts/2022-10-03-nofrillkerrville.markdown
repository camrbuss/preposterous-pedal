Third best ride of the trip today! Lots of huge hills and steady climbs with nice vistas. I love climbing on a bike and I especially love climbing to a view. On the east coast, the lush trees are always blocking the view. 🌳🫣

Funny pic of me getting the selfie shot, and then the selfie. 🤣

Being a 95 mile day required an decent application of sunscreen, so I used the Zinc based Sunbum I’ve been milking. Maybe it’s the bottom of the tube, but that Zinc stuff totally blocks my pores. Immediately after applying it, it felt like my cheeks were choking and it made my skin all gunky. I bought the Great Value chemical stuff to compare. I’ll update with results for any concerned parties.

I finished Peter Singer’s *The Life You Can Save* and am quite inspired to get more involved with Charities and Nonprofits. There are so many avenues to take, but ideally I would like to use my engineering skills to help others in need. Additionally I would like to give blood, platelets, and maybe even bone marrow. I’m going to see if I can give platelets in Austin, TX or Baton Rouge, LA on my rest days. I’d like to do more to help others, but I will always remember I cannot rationalize everything. Peter reminds me that human behavior has “Quirky relics of a tribal past”.

The latter half of the ride was great, but I definitely got the crazies. The landscape transformed from a luscious river with summer camp venues, to wealthy people homes, to bull fighting arenas, and then ending with heavy traffic full of lifted trucks. I’ve only gotten one middle finger, and hundreds of “hello” waves. For what it is worth, this area of Texas has had a much lower rate of reciprocal waves. 🤗🤔🤷

The day ended wonderfully after a great dinner with my Aunt Susan and Uncle Mike. It was great to catch up and receive their loving support!

Both butt cheeks told me today that as long as they get their morning petroleum jelly application, they can go the entire day without a squeak. The only thing is they said my bowels have been throwing a fit due to all the canned food and they don’t like the smell.

And if you were wondering what way the City of Kerrville mounts their toilet paper, you can now know.

Is that the wording you would use? I would’ve phrased the instructions differently.
