We started off the day by loading up the bikes on the vans and shuttling around Mobile Bay because the ferry was down for maintenance. I had fun putting the bikes on the rack and then getting a free whataburger at a pit stop on our 2 hour loop around the bay.

It’s Seth’s birthday, so after unloading the vans we rode out together. We immediately hit paved multi-use paths and my anxiety rose sharply. The paths were super curvy and prime for an accident as I watched squirrelly cyclists attempt to compensate for poor bike handling by shouting about every obstacle they saw. I think I’m a mountain biker at heart because I have the philosophy that everyone should be aware of their surroundings enough to control their bike how they deem appropriate. Obviously if you are drafting, their is a necessary level of communication, but you don’t need to be drafting on multi-use paths.

We stopped at the Florida sign and let all the other riders get way far ahead so we could ride our ride and not their ride.

After riding along the key, we made it to Pensacola and stopped at the pier. This tug boat looked so strong. 💪

A little ways into Pensacola we got on the scenic highway and just sat our ass down on a bench for an hour. It was so great to chat with the birthday boy about gear, bikes, and life.

We ended the night with some karaoke at a brewery with the daddies. 😁🎤🎶
