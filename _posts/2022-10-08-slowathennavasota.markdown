Phew, what a long day! Slowest 65 mile ride I’ve ever done. The trio set off the day together and decided that today was a “no drop ride” so we did the no power spin all freakin day.

The first distraction of the day was the endless acres of antique flee market and over priced pie. Round Top, TX is not the destination for me.

On the way out of the wealthy area we saw the start of an additive manufacturing housing development! Pretty cool!

The landscape has completely forgotten the dessert of West Texas and has regained the trees and grass fields I am used to. This beautiful tree tunnel was a nice break from the heat of the afternoon sun.

The day ended with a nice blizzard from DQ that was way better than the overpriced garbage in the tourist towns. In general the day was filled with great conversation, but I definitely prefer riding at an average of 14 mph.

The only major epiphany of the day was that I don’t need to have an opinion about everything. I can be at peace with seeing the existence of things and simply move on. I know it’s pretty basic, but it shows my constant need to over complicate the decision behind every action.

I’m thinking of all my friends and family more and more. Thank to you all for the support throughout my life!
