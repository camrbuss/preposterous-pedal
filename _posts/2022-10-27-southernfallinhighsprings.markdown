After camping outside of the Madison 4H barn, I set off solo for the long ride today. It’s so nice to not have any hesitation about getting on the bike. Daily life at home always has a way of tricking your mind into not to getting outside. Instead of an afternoon siesta, we should habituate a two hour afternoon outdoor break. Did I use that word correctly? Ehh, whatever.

At the first rest stop I got this nugget of philosophy in the context of why I should take responsibility in all of my actions, large and small.

“I’m not here to move the rock I’m just here to push it.”

After pedaling through some more easy miles, Seth and I stopped at a country diner. The experience was good, plus we got to talk to two young, self-supported, European cyclists doing the Southern Tier. It was funny we both admitted to taking the easy way out in different ways. We had vans carry our stuff, but they took a train through some of the desert. I really want to do a self supported route, but I wonder if I would have as much fun with the additional stress.

Towards the end of the ride we stopped at couple of Floridas many springs. Swimming is always such a blast! The daddies posed for our “Young Mammals Cycling Association” photo.

We are camping at a state park and I’ve got “Fight Club” queued up for movie time. 🌚📺
