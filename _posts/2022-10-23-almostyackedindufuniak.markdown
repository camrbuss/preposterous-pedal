I woke up after a great nights rest on the church basketball court and then threw on my chamois. Thereâ€™s something slightly mischievous about taking a bathroom selfie in a public placeâ€¦ or am I just vain?

Not sure if Iâ€™ve mentioned how happy I am with my bikes bag setup, but itâ€™s been perfect. Shout out to my momma for letting me use one of her panniers from her cross country trip some years ago. The Surly bros enjoy loading up our bikes with comforts for the day.

Honestly the riding all blended together and consisted of random silly talk. My mind has begun to focus more and more on what Iâ€™m doing after the trip and Iâ€™ve come up with several ideas, but we shall see what actually comes to fruition. Only the shadows know what is next ðŸ‘»

After completing the ride at 6pm, the daddies went to the local Chinese buffet. I obviously ate way too much, but it was tasty and I kept it down to nourish my muscles throughout the night.
